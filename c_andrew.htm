<h2>Andrew Character In Free Fire Tips And Tricks</h2>
<p>Along with Adam and Eve, Andrew is a character that all players can get for free when playing Free Fire. However, Adam and Eve have no skill at all. You can get <a title="Everything About Andrew Character In Free Fire: Bio, Tips And Tricks" href="https://gurugamer.com/mobile-games/andrew-character-in-free-fire-10967" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Andrew character in Free Fire</strong></a> from Log-in bonus.</p>
<h3>Tips for Andrew Character In Free Fire</h3>
<p>As the skill mentions, your vest will be much more durable than the vest of your enemies, making your survivability also higher. This makes him more useful in both solo and squad.</p>
<p>In solo, you can trade hit with enemies more effectively (if most shots hit the armor). If the enemy dares to go toe to toe with you, it is likely that they will go down first because you can take more damage. You also have more time to run to covers with Andrew while being in an open field.</p>

<p>In squad mode, while Andrew doesn't buff teammates, he can be the tanker who goes first and takes damage from enemies, allowing your teammate to kill them or run to covers. Also in a tough situation, Andrew can be the one who takes down the whole enemy's team and save the whole team.</p>
<p>For weapon choices, shotguns and SMGs are good as you would want to fight close-quarter combats to maximize your strength.</p>
<h3>Skill combinations with Andrew Character In Free Fire</h3>
<p>Since the skill Armor Specialist increases the survivability of Andrew, it is best to combine his skills with other skills that make you tankier. I recommend you to combine with Antonio, Jota, Shani, Miguel. All these characters have skills that will increase your resilience in battle and they synergy really well with Andrew's skill.</p>
<ul>
<li>Antonio's skill will increase your Max HP at the start of the match, up to 35 HP.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Jota's skill will instantly heal you 40HP after you get a kill using a shotgun or SMG.</li>
<li>Shani's skill will restore your armor durability by 20 after each kill and upgrade it up to Lv 3. Your armor will basically never disappear.</li>
<li>Miguel's skill gains you EP after each kill. Combine with Jota's skill and your HP will always full after each fight.</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining these skills together, you will create an unkillable tank that no player wants to face in combat. It is hard to take you down and you can heal a great amount after each kill, allowing you to have a great potential to kill a whole squad all by yourself.</p>
