<p>While the skill of <strong>Misha character in Free Fire</strong> is not the best skill in Free Fire, it has its own perks, especially when you want to have fun and crush every single player in the game in your car. With the increased speed and the reduced damage, it will be harder for enemies to dodge you or take you down when you are trying to run them over.</p>
<p>With this playstyle, you can combine her skills with Antonio's skill to increase your Max HP at the start of the game and the skill of the upcoming character "Luqueta" to increase your Max HP after each kill. This will turn you into a real unstoppable tank to run over other players.</p>
