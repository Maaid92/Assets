<h2>1 - Caroline's Backstory</h2>
<p>Caroline is the daughter of a very wealthy corporation - she is constantly surrounded by bodyguards. Despite that, Caroline is pretty down to earth and was able to make a lot of friends and admirers, ruling the school in the process. Her best friends are Kelly and Maxim. However, one day, Kelly was kidnapped, and the culprit turned out to be her father - Kelly, her bodyguard Nikita, and Maxim decided to head to the Free Fire island to find out the truth.</p>
<h2>2 - Caroline's Ability</h2>
<p>Caroline is one of the oldest characters ever released in Free Fire, with a pretty "dated" ability. It is more or less even weaker than Kelly's 6% movement speed bonus, as Caroline's "Agility" passive only works when she's holding a shotgun.</p>

<ul>
<li>Level 1: When holding a shotgun, movement speed is increased by 3%</li>
<li>Level 2: When holding a shotgun, movement speed is increased by 4%</li>
<li>Level 3: When holding a shotgun, movement speed is increased by 5%</li>
<li>Level 4: When holding a shotgun, movement speed is increased by 6%</li>
<li>Level 5: Unlock Caroline's Fan Club Jacket</li>
<li>Level 6: When holding a shotgun, movement speed is increased by 7%</li>
<li>Level 7: UnlockÂ Caroline's Grace</li>
<li>Level 8: When holding a shotgun, movement speed is increased by 8%</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that her weapon of choice is a shotgun is also pretty weird, as a shotgun is a pretty crude weapon, not really a match for such a delicate lady like Caroline.</p>

<h2>3 - Tips and tricks on using Caroline</h2>

<p>Overall, Caroline is a decent pick only if you are planning on using shotguns or want to look cute in your costumes. Caroline can be unlocked with 8000 coins.</p>
<p>If you are going to use her in a shotgun build, Jota's ability is a must-have, as you would be able to heal after every kill. Consider getting Hayato's ability to boost the damage of your weapon as well - the shotgun would have some problems against enemies with body armor.</p>
