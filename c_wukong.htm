<h2>1 - Overview of Wukong</h2>
<p>Wukong was released into the game in January 2019 as part of the Impulsive Shock Elite Pass. Currently, you can buy the character in the shop for 499 diamonds or 25000 gold. The character is based on the famous Chinese novel "Journey to the West" in which a Chinese Monk and his three apprentices (including Wukong) journey to India.</p>

<h2>2 - Wukong's Backstory</h2>
<p>In Free Fire, Wukong is actually not a mystical being - he is an actual monkey kidnapped by the FF organization and experimented on. When he was imprisoned in the lab, the scientists have planted an AI into his brain, giving Wukong human-like intelligence.</p>

<p>However, that turned out to be a mistake. When Nikita and Moco hacked the firewall to access the data system of FF, Wukong took advantage of this and escaped.</p>

<h2>3 - Wukong's Ability</h2>
<p>Wukong's ability is pretty much the most unique skill in Free Fire. While other characters only have boring stat buffs and heals, Wukong can turn himself into a bush. This disguise would let him avoid getting damaged by enemies.</p>

<p>Camouflage lasts for 14 seconds and has 200s cooldown at the maximum level. You must stand to use this ability and during its duration, you cannot use any weapons.</p>
<h2>4 - Tips and Tricks on Using Camouflage</h2>
<h3>Escape from inescapable situations</h3>
<p>When attacked, you can just turn into a bush and move to the nearest cover to get away - enemies would not be able to damage you or target you whatsoever. If there are no covers available, create one using Gloo Wall Grenade.</p>

<p>You can heal during the skill's duration and continue to fight immediately as well.</p>
<h3>Sneak Attacks</h3>
<p>You can turn into a bush and flank your enemies... or wait somewhere nearby to ambush them.</p>

<p>Turning into a bush is also the safest way to cross rivers, which are usually swarmed with campers.</p>
