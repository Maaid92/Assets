 <h2>1 - Maxim's Backstory</h2>
 <figure id="attachment_59100" class="wp-caption aligncenter" ><img src="https://img.gurugamer.com/resize/740x-/2020/09/04/maxresdefault-7d08.jpg"  class="wp-image-59100 size-full lazy-image" alt="Maxresdefault" />
 <figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Maxim and Kelly was a great couple</figcaption></figure>
 <p>Maxim is a very cheerful character, who's actually connected to like half the original roster of Free Fire. The guy is the brother of Misha and has a crush on Kelly, while being Caroline's classmate. After Kelly was kidnapped by a mysterious organization, Maxim and Caroline decided to investigate and was caught in the plot as well. They were then brought to the Free Fire island to participate in Battle Royale combat.</p><p>Maxim, despite his pretty boy look, is a glutton who often participates in eating contest - it is really weird that the guy never gets fat.</p>
 <h2>2 - Maxim's Ability</h2>
 <p>Maxim was part of the earliest wave of characters in Free Fire, with abilities that barely affect the game at all. The 12% reduction in consume time is the equivalent of half a second, in the best scenario - there is pretty much no reason to use his skill instead of something more useful like let's say Kelly's Sprint passive.</p>

 <h2>3 - Tips and tricks on using Maxim</h2>

 <p>Consider using the Shiba Inu pet while playing as Maxim - you would be able to find mushroom to fill your character's HP up that way. With maxed Gluttony, your ability to heal in the middle of combat would be slightly faster as well - if possible, try to pop a medkit while fighting if you are not focused. Maxim can be purchased for 8000 gold... however, you probably just purchase the guy for collection purposes.</p>
