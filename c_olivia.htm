<p>Since Olivia's skill only work when she revive another player, her skill is pretty much useless in Solo matches. Her skill will be more useful in Duo or Squad mode. By giving your teammates more HP when they got revived, your team will be able to get back to the fight faster.</p>
<p>The position of Olivia in a Squad is obviously the Supporter. You can pair Olivia's skill with one of the latest character in Free Fire, Kapella, to further heal your teammates. Antonio is always a viable option for almost any build in Free Fire. Kelly's skill will help you to have more mobility in combats can save your teammates faster.</p>
