<p>Nikita actually isn't the real name of <a title="Story Of Free Fire Nikita Character - The Undercover Spy Whose Mission Is To Destroy Free Fire" href="https://gurugamer.com/mobile-games/free-fire-nikita-character-11665" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Free Fire Nikita character</strong></a>. Nikita is her code name. Her real name is Yuna.</p>
<p>While she appears to be the bodyguard of Caroline, the daughter of the chairman of the Free Fire's organization, she is actually a spy who penetrated the organization to steal information. Nikita worked with Moco to leak the information she got from the organization.</p>

<p>The reason why she did this was that the organization kidnapped her friend called Min Ho. When searching for information on Min Ho's computer, Nikita knew that he was investigating this organization call Cobra.</p>
<p>While she is working at the organization, Nikita saw someone who looks just like her friend Min Ho but he didn't recognize her and said he worked for the organization. However, Nikita didn't believe it and stayed there to confirm the truth.</p>
<blockquote><p>He said he was from a coporation and was there for work... but he looks exacly like Min Ho. How could it not be him?!<br />
Are you sure?<br />
No... I am not... but I need to confirm this.</p>

<p>There is a high chance that the guy was actually Minho and he was still investigating that organization. But since he didn't recognize Nikita, he didn't want to blow his cover.</p>

<p>The skill of <strong>Free Fire Nikita character</strong> is quite useful but it is not as good as other skills such as Antonio's skill or Clu's skill. With a fast reload time, <strong>N</strong><span data-sheets-value="{" data-sheets-userformat="{"><strong>ikita character in Free Fire</strong> </span>can re-engage faster than enemies and get the upper hand in long heated battles. You would want to have a more aggressive playstyle with this skill so it would be best to pair it with skills that make her more flexible in battles.</p>
<p>Jota's skill you help you regain HP after a fight using SMG, which synergy well with Nikita. Clu's skill will allow you to locate the locations of enemies and rush to the right place. Miguel's skill will give you EP after each kill to heal more after each fight.</p>
