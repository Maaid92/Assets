Olivia is the only one who can make his determination waver.</p>

<h2>3 - Tips and tricks on using Ford</h2>
<p>If you expect to dawdle outside of the safe zone for a while, picking Ford might be a good choice. He is one of the cheapest characters in the game, costing only 2000 gold. When combined with healing abilities and first aid kits, you can stay outside of the safe zone for and extra-long period of time - this might be useful in earlier stages of the game as you can loot for a few seconds longer.</p>
